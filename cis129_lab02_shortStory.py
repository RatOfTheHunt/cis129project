print("A library drifts across a sea of clouds.")
print("The evening sun shines a orange glow upon the bookcases and lanterns as the day turns to night")

print("As the patrons of the library leave, it becomes even more quiet. The library staff are the last to leave.")
print("...save for one person within the center of the bookcase forest, sleeping among a pile of novels and stories using some papers as a pillow.")
print("The student embarks on adventures and tales within the confines of their dreams.")
